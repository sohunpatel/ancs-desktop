# ANCS for Desktop

> [!NOTE]
> This project is pre-alpha and has many issues and features that are actively being worked on.

This project aims to enable all desktops to use Apple's Apple Notification Center Server (ANCS). Right now, there are some ways of hacking together a bluetooth handler to interact with the service. Bluetooth is OS agnostic (to a point, we still need to keep version of the protocol in mind), so, we should be able to implement a display and interactive API for Linux and Windows operating systems.
